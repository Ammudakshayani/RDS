                                <br>
                                • Quality of construction: There have been concerns about the quality of construction of the houses and whether they are built as per the standards set by the government.

                            <p class="card-text mt-3">The AP YSR Pedalandariki Illu Scheme is being implemented in a phased manner across all the districts of Andhra Pradesh.
